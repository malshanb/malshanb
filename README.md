ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm an Engineering Technology student from Sri Lanka with a passion for contributing to FOSS projects. My main focus is on providing graphical and design support, though I also enjoy working on the occasional code task. I'm always excited to collaborate and help projects improve their visual and user experience!

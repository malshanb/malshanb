# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Malshan!
âš¡ ET Student | FOSS Contributor | Graphic Designer

I'm currently an Electronics & Telecommunications Engineering student based in Sri Lanka. My passion lies in supporting FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) projects, where I provide graphical design assistance and contribute towards creating visually appealing, user-friendly assets. Though I engage less with coding, I focus on enhancing documentation, particularly in making README files cleaner, more reliable, and easier to understand.
ðŸ”§ What I Do:

    FOSS Support: Primarily contributing to the visual and graphical aspects of open-source projects.
    README Improvements: Making documentation clear, organized, and accessible for all users.
    Graphic Design: Leveraging my design skills to enhance user experiences in the FOSS community.

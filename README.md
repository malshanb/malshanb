âš¡ ET Student | FOSS Contributor | Graphic Design Enthusiast

Currently pursuing my studies in Electronics & Telecommunications Engineering in Sri Lanka, I'm passionate about contributing to open-source projects, primarily providing graphical design support. While my coding involvement is less frequent, I focus on improving project documentation, ensuring that README files are clean, reliable, and user-friendly.

ðŸ”§ What I Do:

    FOSS Support: Primarily contributing to the visual and graphical aspects of open-source projects.
    README Improvements: Making documentation clear, organized, and accessible for all users.
    Graphic Design: Leveraging my design skills to enhance user experiences in the FOSS community.
